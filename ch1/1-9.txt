1. Cross-Platform Compatibility
A standard library ensures consistent behavior across different compilers, operating systems, and hardware architectures.
Developers donâ€™t need to rewrite code for different platforms.
Saves time and reduces the complexity of writing portable code.

2. Improved Reliability and Maintenance
Standard libraries are thoroughly tested and maintained by compiler vendors and the C++ standards committee.
They follow strict design principles, making them more robust and secure than many third-party alternatives.
Reduces software bugs, improves security, and ensures long-term support.

3. Eliminates Dependency on Third-Party Libraries
Many projects depend on external libraries, which may have license restrictions, compatibility issues, or maintenance problems.
A standard library removes the need for external dependencies, making codebases simpler and easier to distribute.
Reduces complexity, avoids licensing issues, and ensures long-term availability.
