Design Aims of C++
C++ was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup with the following key aims:
Efficiency & Performance – C++ was intended to provide high performance comparable to C, making it suitable for system programming.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – It introduced classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to support modular and reusable code.
Flexibility & General-Purpose Use – C++ supports both low-level programming (close to hardware) and high-level abstractions, making it versatile.
Compatibility with C – It was designed to be largely compatible with C to allow easy migration of existing C codebases.
Extensibility – Users can define their own data types and operators, allowing for powerful custom abstractions.
Type Safety & Stronger Abstraction – While maintaining performance, C++ aimed to introduce better type checking than C.
Support for Multiple Paradigms – C++ supports procedural, object-oriented, generic (via templates), and functional programming styles.

To What Extent Does C++ Meet These Goals?
Efficiency & Performance: C++ meets this goal exceptionally well, offering fine-grained control over memory (via pointers, manual allocation, etc.), inline functions, and optimizations like RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).
OOP & Abstraction: It successfully implements OOP principles, but excessive use of inheritance and polymorphism can lead to code complexity and performance overhead.
Flexibility & General-Purpose Use: C++ is widely used in systems programming, game development, embedded systems, and high-performance applications like finance and simulations.
Compatibility with C: While mostly compatible, some differences (e.g., stricter type checking, name mangling in C++) can make interoperability non-trivial.
Extensibility: The introduction of operator overloading, templates, and metaprogramming proves that C++ is highly extensible.
Type Safety: C++ improved upon C but still has issues like undefined behavior, buffer overflows, and manual memory management risks. Modern C++ (C++11, C++17, etc.) has improved safety with smart pointers and standard library enhancements.
Multiple Paradigm Support: C++ effectively supports multiple paradigms but can become complex when mixing them, leading to readability and maintainability challenges.
