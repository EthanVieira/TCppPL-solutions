From ChatGPT:

1. Standard Template Library (STL)
A powerful set of generic containers and algorithms for efficient data manipulation.
Containers – Store collections of objects efficiently.
Sequence Containers: vector, array, deque, list, forward_list
Associative Containers: set, multiset, map, multimap
Unordered Containers (hash-based): unordered_set, unordered_multiset, unordered_map, unordered_multimap
Iterators – Provide a way to traverse containers (begin(), end()).
Algorithms – Generic functions for sorting, searching, and modifying data (sort(), find(), copy(), transform()).
Function Objects (Functors) – Enable function-like behavior with objects (std::greater<>, std::less<>).

2. Input/Output (I/O) Library
Handles console and file input/output operations.
Stream-Based I/O:
iostream – Base I/O library
cin, cout, cerr, clog – Standard input, output, error, and logging
File I/O:
fstream – File input and output (ifstream, ofstream, fstream)
String Streams:
sstream – String-based I/O operations (ostringstream, istringstream)

3. String Library
Provides support for text processing.
std::string – A dynamic string class that replaces C-style character arrays.
std::wstring – Supports wide-character (Unicode) strings.
Functions like substr(), find(), replace(), and append().

4. Utility Library
Contains helper functions and classes for common programming tasks.
Smart Pointers: unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr – Improve memory management and prevent memory leaks.
Pair and Tuple: std::pair, std::tuple – Store multiple values in a single object.
Type Traits: std::is_same, std::enable_if – Used in metaprogramming for type checks.
Time Functions: std::chrono – Provides high-resolution timing and date utilities.

5. Multithreading Library (C++11 and later)
Provides tools for concurrent programming.
Threads: std::thread – Create and manage threads.
Mutex and Locks: std::mutex, std::lock_guard, std::unique_lock – Synchronization primitives.
Atomic Operations: std::atomic – Enables lock-free programming.
Futures and Promises: std::async, std::future, std::promise – Supports asynchronous execution.
6. Numerical and Mathematical Library

Provides mathematical functions and numerical algorithms.
General Math: cmath (e.g., sqrt(), pow(), sin(), log()).
Random Number Generation: random (e.g., std::mt19937, std::uniform_int_distribution).
Complex Numbers: std::complex.
Ratios and Fractions: std::ratio.
Valarray: std::valarray – Optimized for numerical computations.

7. Filesystem Library (C++17 and later)
Provides utilities for file and directory manipulation.
Path Handling: std::filesystem::path.
File and Directory Management: std::filesystem::exists(), std::filesystem::create_directory(), std::filesystem::copy_file().
